		 * as a programmer when we write any java code
		 * compiler will comiple the code we get bytecode
		 * again bytecode is executed by jvm in order to get desired output in the console.
		 * JVM will execute the bytecode only if it has main method in it.
		 * why we build the software..?
		 * we build software in order to solve the real problems with the help of virtual solutions
		 * so while building java application we usually process data 
		 * while processing data of user we generally store it in permanent or temprary way
		 * for permanent storage we will make use of data base
		 * for temparary storage we will make use of variables
		 * so here variables are basically placeholder which hold certains data in it.
		 * variables contains two main components in it
		 * name and values
		 * while declaring the variables in java we make use of data type
		 * data type will define the classification of data like what values can be stored and what operation can be performed using those data can be identified with the help of data type
		 * that's why java is called as strongly typed programming language
